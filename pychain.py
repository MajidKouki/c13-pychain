# Step 3:
# Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface

# Code additional input areas for the user interface of your Streamlit
# application. Create these input areas to capture the sender, receiver, and
# amount for each transaction that youâ€™ll store in the `Block` record.
# To do so, complete the following steps:

# 3. Add an input area where you can get a value for `receiver` from the user.
# 4. Add an input area where you can get a value for `amount` from the user.
# 5. As part of the Add Block button functionality, update `new_block` so that `Block` consists of an attribute named `record`, which is set equal to a `Record` that contains the `sender`, `receiver`, and `amount` values. The updated `Block`should also include the attributes for `creator_id` and `prev_hash`.



# Intake sender data from receiver
sender = st.text_input("Sender")

# Intake receiver data from user
receiver = st.text_input("Receiver")

# Intake amount data from user
amount = st.text_input("Amount")


if st.button("Add Block"):
    prev_block = pychain.chain[-1]
    prev_block_hash = prev_block.hash_block()


    new_block = Block(
        record=Record,
        creator_id=42,
        prev_hash=prev_block_hash
    )

    pychain.add_block(new_block)
    st.balloons()

# Use markdown to decorate app
st.markdown("## The PyChain Ledger")

# Create a dataframe using pychain data and display it
pychain_df = pd.DataFrame(pychain.chain).astype(str)
st.write(pychain_df)

# Create difficulty slider for sidebar
difficulty = st.sidebar.slider("Block Difficulty", 1, 5, 2)

# Create block inspector for sidebar and display the selected block
st.sidebar.write("# Block Inspector")
selected_block = st.sidebar.selectbox(

# Step 4:
# Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records

# Test your complete `PyChain` ledger and user interface by running your
# Streamlit application and storing some mined blocks in your `PyChain` ledger.
# Then test the blockchain validation process by using your `PyChain` ledger.
# To do so, complete the following steps:

# 1. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder where you've coded the
#  Challenge.

# 2. In the terminal, run the Streamlit application by
# using `streamlit run pychain.py`.

# 3. Enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then click the "Add
# Block" button. Do this several times to store several blocks in the ledger.

# 4. Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu.
# Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should detail a
# blockchain that consists of multiple blocks. Include the screenshot in the
# `README.md` file for your Challenge repository.

# 5. Test the blockchain validation process by using the web interface.
# Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should indicate
# the validity of the blockchain. Include the screenshot in the `README.md`
# file for your Challenge repository.
